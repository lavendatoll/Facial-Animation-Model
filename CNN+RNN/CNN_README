Preprocess Dataset:

	Put all speech files in ./speech folder
	Put train video files in ./train/video folder
	Put test video files in ./test/video folder

	Use python3 to run preprocess_train.py and preprocess_test.py to get feature array
	such as: python3 preprocess_train.py   OR  python3 preprocess_test.py

Train CNN:
	Create folder called CNN_record in the same path(./)

	Use python3 to run CNN_train.py
	such as: python3 CNN_train.py

Evaluation CNN:
	Use python3 to run CNN_eval.py
	such as: python3 CNN_train.py

Make Prediction of landmarks:
	Creat folder called predict_landmark
	Use python3 to run predict.py with arguments which is an speech file endwith .wav
	such as: python3 predict.py ./speech/03-01-01-01-01-01-01.wav
	The output is some images and a gif files. Images are in predict_landmark folder. GIF file is in the same path called landmarks.gif
